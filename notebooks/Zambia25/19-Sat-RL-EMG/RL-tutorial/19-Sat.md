## Contents
* `rl_tutorial_trend2025.ipynb`: this is the notebook we will go through for the tutorial! It will throw errors if you try to run it all the way through. We'll add code to make it run during the tutorial.
* `plotting.py`: has some convenience functions for plotting. You shouldn't need to look at this, but feel free (it's not very well documented). 
* `env_utils.py`: has some convenience functions for setting up environments. You shouldn't need to look at this, but feel free (it's not very well documented either).
